# A2C is a special case of PPO

We can match PPO and A2C's performance exactly by doing the following tweaks in PPO:

1. Match the learning rate parameter to be exactly $0.0007$ (also means turning off learning rate annealing), the entropy coefficient to $0$, and the number of steps to be $5$.
1. Turn off advantage normalization
1. Disable GAE by setting its `lambda` parameter to 1.
1. Set the number of update epochs $K$ to 1, so the clipped objective has nothing to clip.
1. Perform update on the whole batch of training data (`batch_size = n_envs * n_steps`)
1. Disable value function clipping.
1. Use A2C's RMSprop optimizer and configurations

To see it in action, run

```python
poetry install
poetry run python sb3_ppo.py
poetry run python sb3_a2c.py
```

we get the following screenshot, which shows the sum of the updated models' first layer's weights and they are exactly the same

Therefore, A2C is a special case of PPO when PPO 1) uses learning rate $=0.0007$ and turn off learning rate annealing,  2) set entropy coefficient $=0$, 3) set number of steps $=5$, 4) turn off advantage normalization, 5) disable GAE, 6) set update epoch $K=1$, 7) use whole batch of data for update, 8) disable value function clipping, and 9) use the RMSprop optimizer.
